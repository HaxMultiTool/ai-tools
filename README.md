Most of these tools are based off OpenAI requests.<br>
In order to make these work, you will need an API Key from OpenAI's developers webpage.<br>

### Privacy and models training
The content in the API Requests (users input(s)) are not used to improve models, <br>
as stated in [openai's article](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/how-we-use-your-data)

### Tools code
