# Hax-MultiTool's AI Tools
In this repository you can find AI Tools from Hax MultiTool.
Most of these tools are based off OpenAI requests.

In order to make these work, you will need an API Key from OpenAI's developers webpage.
The API Requests are not used to improve models, as statement in [openai's article](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/how-we-use-your-data)
